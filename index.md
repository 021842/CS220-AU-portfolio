Hello! My name is Krisztián Hofstädter, aka tEdör. I am a creative technologist working as a researcher, lecturer, freelancer and artist. I made this website using a GitHub to help students at the University of Essex create a simple website for free, that is blazing fast and does only take a couple of minutes to set up.
