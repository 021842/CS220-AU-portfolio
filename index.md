**Undergraduate Sociology Student**  

Hi! My name is Gorse Wilkins, aka G. 

I am a first year undergraduate student at the University of Essex. I grew up in Ireland and moved here to study. I have previously completed a one year Btec course studying social studies and psychology and I am now currently studying towards a BA in Sociology. I have always had an interest in sociology and having a career that was based around helping others. I was fascinated at how polotical policies shaped the direction of society and, why people act in the way they do, not only how we shape our society but how it shapes us, its these questions that led me to want to study sociology at a degree level.

Besides working on the Enhancing Audio Description project as a research assistant, my doctoral research developed brain-computer music interfaces for meditation, in which I link neurofeedback to auditory entrainment in generative soundscapes inspired by shamanic journeying. I have also been teaching music technology-related subjects (e.g. sonic art, sensor technology and music for the moving image) as an associate lecturer at the Anglia Ruskin University, Cambridge and the University of Bedfordshire and currently teach a module on sensemaking and digital identities at the School of Philosophy and Arts History at the University of Essex. As a freelancer and artist, I have been producing sound design and music, websites and visual art, including photography and paintings.
