Dear CS220 cohorts, 

This page examples a simple home page that

- gives a brief introduction to my professional identity
- provides links to my social platforms
- outlines current projects
- outlines education and selected work experience, etc. 

You can use it as a template, amend it, change it completely, etc. or create your own from scratch. 

As you can see on my [website](https://khofstadter.com/), my home page simply links to a PDF version of my general CV, instead of writing all the information out on the home page. You can choose as you wish, but be aware that when you submit a CV for a job, you should customise that CV for that specific job. Good practice is to have a general/full CV with all your accomplishments (and aspirations) and then edit this full CV for each job you apply for. 

For inspiration, please check the following links:

- https://github.com/makersacademy/CV
- https://github.com/elipapa/markdown-cv (more advanced as it uses CSS as well)
- https://sive.rs/ (not on GitHub, but gives you a good idea for minimalism)
- https://www.higheredjobs.com/Articles/articleDisplay.cfm?ID=2619
- https://enhancv.com/blog/seth-godin-resume/

We will discuss ideas for making CVs in the workshops.

Thanks, k

# Krisztián Hofstädter
**Creative technologist with teaching, technical and artistic skills**  

Hello! My name is Krisztián Hofstädter, aka tEdör. 

I am a creative technologist working as a researcher, lecturer, freelancer and artist. Besides working on the Enhancing Audio
Description project as a research assistant, my doctoral research developed brain-computer music interfaces for meditation, in which I link neurofeedback to auditory entrainment in generative soundscapes inspired by shamanic journeying. I have also been teaching music technology-related subjects (e.g. sonic art, sensor technology and music for the moving image) as an associate lecturer at the Anglia Ruskin University, Cambridge and the University of Bedfordshire and currently teach a module on sensemaking and digital identities at the School of Philosophy and Arts History at the University of Essex. As a freelancer and artist, I have been producing sound design and music, websites and visual art, including photography and paintings. 

Note: I wrote this short bio to go with a recent journal publication where I was co-editor. On my personal website this bio is much shorter. Writing this bio (or abstract) is not easy, most people rewrite very oftern before they consider it final. So should you. Experiment and ask for feedback.

### Doctoral Research
This interdisciplinary research developed and tested open-source brain-computer music interfaces for scientific and artistic purposes. These interfaces were primarily developed for neurofeedback practitioners interested in using auditory entrainment to support meditation practices and for creative technologists interested in using real-time electroencephalography to support artistic practices. The outcome of this research is a portfolio of creative work including the source code of both interfaces, audio releases, public presentations and performances, as well as the submitted commentary which not only reflects on the research process but also serves as a guide for other researchers and artists interested in developing new BCMIs. While developing my artistic vision and technical skills, the research also stabilised my meditation practice into regular sense-making procedures providing well-being and meaning.

<br>

## WORK EXPERIENCE
