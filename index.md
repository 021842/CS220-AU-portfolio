**Undergraduate Sociology Student**  

Hi! My name is Gorse, aka G. 

I am a first year undergraduate student at the University of Essex. I grew up in the West of Ireland, In  a very rural place called Lough Key, beautiful but I needed a change so i moved country both to study and to experience life in a City. I have previously completed a one year Btec course studying social studies and psychology and I am now currently studying towards a BA in Sociology. I have always had an interest in sociology and having a career that was based around helping others. I was fascinated at how political policies shaped the direction of society and, why people act in the way they do, not only how we shape our society but how it shapes us, its these questions that led me to want to study sociology at a degree level.
