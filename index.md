Hello! My name is Krisztián Hofstädter, aka tEdör. I am a creative technologist working as a researcher, lecturer, freelancer and artist. I made this website using a GitHub repository to help students at the University of Essex create a simple website for free, that is blazing fast and does only take a couple of minutes to set up. 

My current personal website can be found [here](https://khofstadter.com/) and my LinkedIn profile [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tedor).
