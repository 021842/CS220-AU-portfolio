## questions to explore
- how relevant is Prensky's digital natives and immigrants idea today e.g. can younger people use the Web more efficiently than older people? 
- do I know people who are much older than me and can use the Web more efficiently?
- what does it actually mean 'to use the Web more efficiently'?
- what's the difference between White's and Prensky's idea regarding people engaging with technology e.g. the Web?
- what's the main difference between White's visitor and resident modes?
- reflect on how you use digital technology in different contexts - explore your own 'digital journey' by thinking about the different digital devices you - - have bought (or been given) over your lifetime
