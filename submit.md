## checklist
<!-- #todo check all -->
- [ ] my GitHub /username matches my student registration number
- [ ] this repository is named 'CS220-AU-portfolio'
- [ ] I amended the `di-reflection.md` file with my own reflection on my digital identities. I undestand that this reflection could alternatively be submitted in a PDF file on FASER if I wanted to keep my writing more private i.e. not puplically available in this repository online. (I deleted the 'di-reflection.md' file from this repository when submitting a PDF version of it on FASER.)
- [ ] I amended the `index.md` file to support one of my own resident identities (or projects) and used GitHub Pages to create a one page website from this file. I understand that as an alternative to GitHub Pages, I could have used an another content management system e.g. Wordpress to create my website and that I could have added additional pages if essential.
- [ ] I filled in the self assessment tables below
- [ ] I filled in the peer assessment tables below

## self assessment
<!-- #todo fill in, perhaps update weekly -->
To measure my own progress, I filled in the table below using the module's [Digital Portfolio Rubric](https://github.com/krisztian-hofstadter-tedor/CS220-AU-portfolio/blob/main/assets/doc/digital-portfolio-rubric.md).

## peer assessment
To help measure my progress, I asked two of my classmates to reflect on my progress using the module's [Digital Portfolio Rubric](https://github.com/krisztian-hofstadter-tedor/CS220-AU-portfolio/blob/main/assets/doc/digital-portfolio-rubric.md).
