<!-- #ktodo
- need to for example rubric - just add to self and then to peer assessment
- have a general table for general e.g. lower second, 60+, good, etc. 
- and then just the % e.g 60 % in the rubric table - this way the text can have more space in the rubric

## Checklist
### General
- [ ] my GitHub username matches my student registration number
- [ ] my repository to submit is named 'CS220-AU-portfolio'
### Reflection
- [ ] I amended the `di-reflection.md` file with my own reflection on my digital identities. I undestand that this reflection could alternatively be submitted in a PDF file on FASER if I wanted to keep my writing more private i.e. not puplically available in this repository online. (I deleted the 'di-reflection.md' file from this repository when submitting a PDF version of it on FASER to avoid confusion.)
### Website
- [ ] I amended the `index.md` file to support one of my own professional/institutional resident identities (or projects) and used GitHub Pages to create a one page website from this file. I understand that as an alternative to GitHub Pages, I could have used an another content management system e.g. Wordpress to create my website and that I could have added additional pages if essential.
- [ ] I provided a URL to my website in the repository's `README.md` file
### Self and peer assessment
- [ ] I familiarised myself with the marking rubric below for my self and peer assessments
- [ ] I filled in the self assessment tables below
- [ ] I filled in the peer assessment tables below for which two people in my CS220 group provided feedback for
- [ ] I provided feedback for two people in my CS220 group using the marking rubric below
