## Checklist
### General
- [ ]  my GitHub username matches my student registration number
- [ ] my repository to submit is named 'CS220-AU-portfolio'
### Reflection
- [ ] I amended the `di-reflection.md` file with my own reflection on my digital identities. I undestand that this reflection could alternatively be submitted in a PDF file on FASER if I wanted to keep my writing more private i.e. not puplically available in this repository online. (I deleted the 'di-reflection.md' file from this repository when submitting a PDF version of it on FASER to avoid confusion.)
### Website
- [ ] I amended the `index.md` file to support one of my own professional/institutional resident identities (or projects) and used GitHub Pages to create a one page website from this file. I understand that as an alternative to GitHub Pages, I could have used an another content management system e.g. Wordpress to create my website and that I could have added additional pages if essential.
- [ ] I provided a URL to my website in the repository's `README.md` file
