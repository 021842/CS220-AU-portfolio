## Checklist
<!-- #todo : complete the checklist below by simply replacing the space with an 'x' as seen in the first checkpoint below. --> 

### General
I made sure that
- [x] my GitHub username matches my student registration number
- [ ] my repository to submit is named 'CS220-AU-portfolio'.

### Reflection
In the `di-reflection.md` file I
- [ ] added my own reflection on my digital identities. I understand that this reflection could alternatively be submitted in a PDF file on FASER if I wanted to keep my writing more private i.e. not publically  available in this repository. (I deleted the 'di-reflection.md' file from this repository when submitting a PDF version of it on FASER to avoid confusion.)

### Website
I used the `index.md` file 
- [ ] to support one of my own professional/institutional identities (or projects) and used the GitHub Pages function to turn this file into a website. I understand that as an alternative to GitHub Pages, I could have used another content management system e.g. WordPress to create my website and that I could have added additional pages if essential.
- [ ] I provided a URL to my website in the repository's `README.md` file

### Self- and peer-assessment
In the `assessement.md` file I
- [ ] familiarised myself with the marking rubric
- [ ] filled in the self-assessment table
