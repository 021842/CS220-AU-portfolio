## reflection on my digital identity

This writing reflects on my understanding of

1. digital identities in general
2. my own digital identities in the past/present
3. my own digital identities in the future

### digital identities
To help identify and improve my own digital identities, I explored 
- White et al.'s Visitor and Resident (V&R) concept which 
  - says this and that 
  - and out of these things that they wrote, I found this and that interesting, and therefore researched this and that further and found this and that, etc. 

### my past/present digitial identity/identities
Using White et al.'s V&R map, I identified the following ways I engage with the Web in my visitor and resident modes:

## questions to explore
- how relevant is Prensky's digital natives and immigrants idea today e.g. can younger people use the Web more efficiently than older people? 
- do I know people who are much older than me and can use the Web more efficiently?
- what does it actually mean 'to use the Web more efficiently'?
- what's the difference between White's and Prensky's idea regarding people engaging with technology e.g. the Web?
- what's the main difference between White's visitor and resident modes?
- reflect on how you use digital technology in different contexts - explore your own 'digital journey' by thinking about the different digital devices you have bought (or been given) over your lifetime
- how can/should I (or shouldn't)  link my personal identities to my professional identites?
- what implications do our resident identities have on our professional life?
- how do we assess the credibility of information comming other people's (or institutions) resident identies e.g. does it matter who good their profile picture looks or how well their website is designed? 
- how much fact checking should people do who visit my resident identities e.g. websites or social accounts and who much fact checking do I do when visiting others' resident identities?
- is an information's creditibily in line with how high the information ranks using a search engine?
- is an information's creditibily in line with the creditibility (or number of followers) of a mainstream or alternative broadcaster, its references and who it was reviewed by? Can the information be biast or could there be a conflict of interest? 
- what does it mean to critically evaluate information i.e. what is critical thinking?
- how do I develop my critical thinking regarding my engagment on the Web in my visitor and resident modes?
