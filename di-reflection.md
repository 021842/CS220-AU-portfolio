## Reflection on digital identities

This writing briefly reflects on my understanding of

- digital identities in general
- my own digital identities in the past/present
- my own digital identities in the future

<br>

### Digital identities
To help identify and improve my own digital identities, I explored 
- [White et al.'s Visitor and Resident (V&R) concept](http://daveowhite.com/vandr/) which 
  - says this and that as well as that
  - and out of these, I found this and that interesting, and therefore researched them further and found this and that, etc. 

Note: The module outline has a page on [digital identities](https://github.com/krisztian-hofstadter-tedor/CS220-AU-navigating-the-digital-world/blob/main/digital-identities.md) - revise if needed. If you can, add more references i.e. not just the one to White et al. 

<br>

### My past/present digitial identity/identities
Using the V&R map, I identified the following ways I engage with the Web in my visitor and resident modes (see photo/diagram below). 

<br><br>![V&R map plain](assets/img/vr-map-plain.svg)<br><br>

To clarify, in 

- my visiting modes the main activity is ...
- my resident modes the main activity is ...
- the difference between my personal and insitutinal modes is ...
- etc. 

<br>

### My future digitial identity/identities
To help develop my digital identies I have used
- revised my current use of digital identities (thought about it critically)
- discussed it with my cohort and friends
- found this and that in journal papers/books/internet which helped understand where and how I could improve 
- used a [SWOT](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=swot&t=brave&ia=web) analysis (or another method that can help personal development) that helped understsand my next steps
- etc. 

Note: Make sure you not only write about what you think needs imporving but also about what you think you are already doing well. A good starting point is to talk about the good things you already do and then dive into what needs improving. In the next heading you can list the aspects of your identities that need improving and then write about what ideas/methods you plan to use to improve them. 

After identifying and analysing my current use of digital identities on the Web, I set the goal to ...

<br>

#### Objective 1 (example)
The above V&R map and its analysis highlighted ...

In order to address this (weakness/threat) I plan to 
- do this and that (read this and that, join a specific forum, amend/delete/add this or that, ...)
- by this deadline (perhaps you could write that you will set aside 1 hour every Monday to work on this objective)

<br>

#### Objective 2 (example)
...

By addressing these objectives my V&R map will look as follows:

### Summery
In this writing reflected on my understanding of

1. digital identities in general and highlighted this and that
2. my own digital identities in the past/present and highlighted this and that
3. my own digital identities in the future and highlighted this and that

### Questions you should/could expore 
- do I know people who are much older than me and can use technology e.g. the Web more efficiently?
- what does it actually mean 'to use the Web more efficiently'?
- what's the difference between White et al.'s and Prensky's idea regarding people engaging with technology?
- on the V&R map, what's the main difference between 'visitor' modes and 'resident' modes and what does the 'personal on institutional' dimension provide?
- how have I been using digital technology in different contexts i.e. how has my 'digital journey' changed since my first device e.g. the one given to me by parents?
- how can/should I (or shouldn't) link my personal identities to my professional identites?
- what implications do my visitory identities have on my personal life?
- what implications do my personal identities have on my professinal/institutional life?
- what implications do my resident identities have on my personal life?
- what implications do my resident identities have on my professinal/institutional life?
- how do I assess the credibility of information comming other people's (or institutions) resident identies e.g. does it matter how good their profile picture looks or how well their website is designed? 
- how much fact checking could people do when visiting my resident identities e.g. mywebsites or social accounts and who much fact checking do I need to do when referencing other's work?
- is an information's creditibily in line with how high the information ranks using a search engine?
- is an information's creditibily in line with the creditibility (or number of followers) of a mainstream or alternative broadcaster, its references and perhaps whom it was reviewed by? Can the information be biased or could there be a conflict of interest? 
- what does it mean to critically evaluate information i.e. what is critical thinking?
- how do I develop my critical thinking regarding my engagment on the Web in my visitor and resident modes?
- what is my digital capability e.g. what aspect of technology am I confortable/unconfortable with?
- how can I improve my online presence e.g. by monitoring the time I spend on social media vs. work when using my computing device?
- how can I improve the way I interact with information online e.g. can I access a more mindful/objective instead of more reactive/emotional/bias state of mind before sharing or commenting on something online?
- what information about my developing digital identities am I confident sharing publicaly?

- maybe have the two above maps next to each other for the reader to easily compare (as well) -->
