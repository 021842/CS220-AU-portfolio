# CS220 AU portfolio
## Overview
This GitHub repository is a template for the [CS220 AU](https://github.com/krisztian-hofstadter-tedor/CS220-AU-navigating-the-digital-world) assignment, your digital portfolio.

In essence, it demonstrates the use of [Markdown language](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) for
- clear project management
- writing articles
- web-design with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
- self- and peer-assessment

<br>

At the end of the module, you will need submit a link to your own repository through FASER.

## Portfolio items
In essence, your repository needs to contain the following:

1. **portfolio overview** - a succinct overview of your portfolio and an outline of completed tasks (log) and tasks to do (TODO) in the `README.md` file
2. **DI reflection** - a short written work reflecting on developing your digital identies including visitor and resident modes in the `di-reflection.md` file
3. **website** - a simple website supporting your institutional/professional identity or one of your projects using the `index.md` file and GitHub Pages function. You can add your DI reflection as additional page to your website. 
4. **self- and peer-assessments** - marking rubrics to streamline your progress

When you finished these items, you will need to add your student number and your portfolio's URL in the `submit.md` file, complete a checklist in the same file and then submit this file on FASER.

How to use this GitHub repository as a template for your submission, including how to submit your `submit.md` file is demonstrated in the workshops. 

### Flexibilities 
1. you can have more than two pages on your website if needed
2. your website can be made with another content management system (CMS) e.g. WordPress instead of GitHub Pages (just make sure you provide a link to your website in your `README.md` file)
3. your DI reflection can be submitted as a PDF file instead of an .md file in your repository. **You should do this** if you feel that your reflection contains information that you do not want to have on a public website. We will discuss this in class.
