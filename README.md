# CS220 AU portfolio

## overview
This GitHub repository is a template for the [CS220 AU module](https://github.com/krisztian-hofstadter-tedor/CS220-AU-navigating-the-digital-world) assignment, the digital portfolio you need to submit.

At the end of the module, you need to 
1. complete the checklist in the `submit.md` file
2. format this `submit.md` file into PDF format
3. rename this PDF file with your student number e.g. `2002012.pdf`
4. submit this PDF file on [FASER](https://faser.essex.ac.uk/)

<!-- #todo make screencast and link video -->

How to create a GitHub account and amend this repository for your personal digital porfolio, including all of the above steps, is demonstrated in the workshops. 

This repository demonstrates
- the use of [Markdown language](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) for project management e.g. logging and elementary webdesign including embeddign audio-visual assets
- turns Markdown files (.md) into [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) (a free statice website)
- provides a self and peer assesment tool (Hofstadter, 2019)

## website to submit
Two .md files in this repository are turned into a [static website](https://krisztian-hofstadter-tedor.github.io/CS220-AU-portfolio/). The `index.md` file is turned into a home page and the `di-reflection.md` file is turned into an additinal page. While both of these pages should demonstrate your aesthetic, technical and critical thinking skills, the home page should outline <!-- #todo is there are better phrase for this --> one of your choosen digital identites (personal, professional or one linked to a specific project of yours), the additinal page, the di-reflection page, should refect on how you have used the [V&R map](https://krisztian-hofstadter-tedor.github.io/CS220-AU-navigating-the-digital-world/digital-identities) to develop your modes of engagment on the Web. 

Flexibilities:   
1. you could have more than two pages on your website 
2. instead of GitHub Pages, you can use another content manamement system (CMS) e.g. Wordpress to design your website
3. instead of reflecting on your visitor and resident modes on a public website e.g. using this GitHub repository or a Wordpress website, you can submit a PDF version of your reflection on FASER. To clarify, in this case you will submit two PDF files on FASER: (1) the `submit.md` with a completed checklist and formated in PDF and (2) your di-reflection in PDF. This di-reflection file in PDF still needs follow the template/guide provided in the `di-reflection.md` file. If you decide to work on your di-reflection privately, you could choose to do this in a private GitHub repository or even in your choosen text editor e.g. Word and then submit the PDF version via FASER.
