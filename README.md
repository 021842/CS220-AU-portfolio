# CS220 AU portfolio

## Overview
This GitHub repository is a template for the [CS220 AU module's](https://github.com/krisztian-hofstadter-tedor/CS220-AU-navigating-the-digital-world) assignment, your digital portfolio.

To submit your assignment, you need to
1. complete the checklist in the `submit.md` file
2. convert this `submit.md` file into a PDF file
3. rename this PDF file to indicate the module code and your student number e.g. `CS220-AU-2002012.pdf`
4. submit this PDF file on [FASER](https://faser.essex.ac.uk/)

<!-- #todo make screencast and link video -->

How to create a GitHub account and amend this repository for your submission, including all the above steps, is demonstrated in the workshops. 

This repository
- uses [Markdown language](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) for project management e.g. logging and elementary web design
- turns Markdown files (.md) into [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) (a free statice website)
- provides a self and peer assessment tool (Hofstadter, 2019)

Two .md files in this repository are turned into a [static website](https://krisztian-hofstadter-tedor.github.io/CS220-AU-portfolio/). The `index.md` file is turned into a home page and the `di-reflection.md` file is turned into an additional page. While both pages should demonstrate your aesthetic, technical and critical thinking skills, the home page should outline <!-- #todo is there a better phrase for this --> one of your chosen resident identities (institutional/professional or one linked to a specific project of yours - perhaps it could be a start on your major project?). The additional page, the di-reflection page, should reflect on your use of the [V&R map](https://krisztian-hofstadter-tedor.github.io/CS220-AU-navigating-the-digital-world/digital-identities) to help develop your digital identities in both, visitor and resident modes.

Flexibilities:   
1. you can have more than two pages on your website if needed
2. your website can be be made with another content management system (CMS) e.g. WordPress instead of GitHub Pages
3. your reflection can be submitted as a PDF file instead a web page. To clarify, in this case, you will submit two PDF files on FASER: (1) the PDF version of the completed `submit.md` file as described above and (2) the PDF version of your `di-reflection.md` file. **You should do this** if you feel that your reflection contains information that you do not want to have on a public website. We will discuss this in class thouroughly.
