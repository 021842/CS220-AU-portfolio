# CS220 AU portfolio

## overview
This GitHub repository is a template for the CS220 AU module assignment, your digital portfolio. 

At the end of the module, you need to 
1. complete the checklist in the `assessment.md` file
2. format this `assessment.md` file into PDF format
3. rename the new PDF file with your student number e.g. `2002012.pdf`
4. submit this PDF version on [FASER](https://faser.essex.ac.uk/)

How to create a GitHub account and amend this repository for your digital porfolio, including all of the above steps, is demonstrated in the workshops. 

This repository
- examples the use of [Markdown language](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) for project management e.g. logging and webdesign including embeddign audio-visual assets
- turns Markdown files (.md) into [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) (a statice website)
- provides a self and peer assesment tool (Hofstadter, 2019)

## website
Two .md files in this repository are turned into a [static website](https://krisztian-hofstadter-tedor.github.io/CS220-AU-portfolio/). The `index.md` is turned into a home page and the `reflection.md` is turned into an additinal page. While both of these pages should demonstrate your aesthetic, technical and critical thinking skills, the home page should support <!-- #todo is there are better phrase for this --> one of your choosen digital identites (personal, professional or one linked to a specific project of yours), the additinal page should refect on how you have used the Visitors and Residents Map (White, <!-- #todo add date -->) to develop your visitor and resident modes of engagment on the Web. 

Flexibilities:   
1. you could have more than two pages on your website 
2. instead of GitHub Pages, you can use another content manamement system (CMS) e.g. Wordpress to design your website
3. instead of reflecting about ydeveloping your visitor and resident modes of engagment on the Web on a public website e.g. in your GitHub Pages or Wordpress website, you can submit a PDF version of your reflection on FASER. To clarify, in this case you will submit two PDF files on FASER: (1) the `assessment.md` with a completed checklist and formated in PDF and (2) your reflection in PDF. This reflection file in PDF format should still follow the template/guide provided in the `reflection.md` file.
